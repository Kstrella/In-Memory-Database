# Suggestions for Official Assignment

# Clarification of Instructions

Possibly add a section that highlights expected behavior or output output when methods are called.

# Additional Methods

A method that might be benificial to include in a complete assignment could be the addition of a delete(key) funcntion.
This can be used to remove keys from the database, while not needed for this excersise, it would be helpful to learn how to implement.

# Grading Improvements

Possibly using some sort of automated testing to grade the assignment would be benificial. Giving students a set of unit tests so that we can make sure that we are on the right track would be helpful in a full assignment.
 

# Extra Feature

A feature that could also be useful in a complete assignment would be to implement a feature where the transactions are logged into a file.
